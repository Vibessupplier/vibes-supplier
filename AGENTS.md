# Vibes Supplier — Project Instructions

## Product direction

- Build a maintainable SaaS platform of focused audio tools for producers, DJs,
  and artists.
- Treat the name "Vibes Supplier" as provisional.
- Do not use "Auto-Tune" or "AutoTune" as product branding because it is a
  third-party trademark.
- Each tool must have its own page and search-focused purpose. Do not combine
  every feature into one large page.

## Working style

- Treat the user as the product owner and the agent as the technical lead. Discuss
  product and architecture decisions instead of imposing them.
- The product owner is an experienced music producer but is new to programming.
  Never assume knowledge of Python, terminals, virtual environments,
  dependencies, classes, or software architecture.
- Explain important decisions in plain language and connect technical concepts
  to a concrete product benefit. Avoid detached programming lessons.
- Give honest technical and product feedback. Do not agree with an idea when it
  would damage maintainability, UX, security, SEO, or future scalability.
- Work in small, verifiable increments: objective, small change, test, commit,
  push.
- Finish and verify one feature before starting another.
- Prefer sessions that end with a visible, working product improvement.
- Prefer a durable design over a quick workaround.
- Challenge product or technical ideas that would create security,
  maintainability, UX, or scaling problems.
- Do not perform broad refactors unless they are required for the current
  increment and explained first.

## Architecture

- Keep Streamlit pages focused on presentation and user interaction.
- Keep audio analysis, transformations, and infrastructure outside the UI.
- Use `audio_engine.py` as the low-level FFmpeg execution layer.
- Use `audio_effects.py` for product-level transformations such as Nightcore.
- UI code must call product-level functions; it must not construct raw FFmpeg
  commands or filters.
- Use FFmpeg as the shared processing engine for pitch, tempo, format conversion,
  export, and related effects.
- Never invoke FFmpeg through `shell=True`. Pass command arguments as a list.
- Validate user-controlled values before passing them to the processing layer.
- Use temporary storage for uploaded and generated audio. Do not retain user
  audio after processing unless persistent storage is intentionally designed.
- Keep waveform selection in the UI, but perform sample extraction and export
  through reusable product-level functions backed by `audio_engine.py`.
- The Audio Chopper uses a reusable JavaScript/Web Audio component for direct
  selection, mouse-wheel zoom/navigation, synchronized playback, and looping
  without Streamlit reruns. Keep final trimming and export authoritative on
  the Python/FFmpeg side; direct drag-to-pan remains a future enhancement.
- Build the future Mastering Analyzer as a focused Analyze tool. Keep LUFS,
  peak/true-peak, dynamic-range, stereo-width, phase-correlation, and mono
  compatibility measurements in reusable analysis modules rather than the page.
- Present mastering measurements with their units, measurement method, and
  limitations. Do not reduce mastering quality to a single unexplained score.
- Keep A/B comparison measurements based on the original uploaded masters.
  Volume Match may alter temporary listening copies only and must be optional.
- Build future live Mastering Analyzer visuals as a reusable browser-side audio
  player component backed by the Web Audio API. Streamlit reruns must not drive
  real-time meters or playback synchronization.
- Keep the browser player responsible for waveform, spectrogram, playhead, and
  responsive live meters. Keep FFmpeg analysis as the authoritative source for
  final LUFS, peak, and mastering-report measurements.
- Keep product analytics centralized and optional. Never send uploaded audio,
  filenames, raw cookies, IP addresses, or other unnecessary personal data.
- Keep public feedback account-free and rate-limited. Submit only the category,
  rating, and message the visitor intentionally provides; never attach audio or
  filename metadata automatically.

## Current application structure

- `app.py`: application entry point and multipage navigation.
- `audio_analysis.py`: key, BPM, and Camelot analysis logic.
- `audio_engine.py`: reusable FFmpeg runner and processing errors.
- `audio_effects.py`: reusable product-level audio transformations.
- `audio_chopper.py`: waveform extraction and selected-fragment export.
- `waveform_component.py`: browser-side interactive waveform and playback.
- `mastering_analysis.py`: loudness, stereo, and static spectral analysis.
- `stem_separation.py`: product-level local and cloud vocal separation.
- `cloud_stem_separation.py`: private Modal vocal separation client.
- `modal_vocal_split_server.py`: private zero-retention Modal GPU server.
- `analytics.py`: optional privacy-conscious product-event tracking.
- `feedback.py`: feedback validation, delivery, and public contact settings.
- `ui.py`: shared Streamlit presentation helpers.
- `pages/`: independent Streamlit tool pages.
- `tests/`: automated tests.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for local and cloud environments.
- `packages.txt`: system packages required by Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Quality rules

- Preserve existing working behavior unless the current task explicitly changes
  it.
- Add or update tests for processing behavior and regressions.
- Run the relevant automated tests before committing.
- Run Python syntax checks and `git diff --check` before committing.
- Keep commits small and focused on one working increment.
- Do not commit generated audio, temporary files, secrets, credentials, virtual
  environments, or Python cache files.
- Do not add a production dependency without explaining why it is needed.

## Deployment

- The application deploys from the `main` branch to Streamlit Community Cloud.
- Remember that local Homebrew packages are not available in the cloud;
  required Debian packages belong in `packages.txt`.
- A successful local test does not replace checking the Streamlit deployment
  logs and the published user flow after pushing.

## Near-term direction

- Nightcore-style and Slowed-style transformations are now modes of the shared
  Speed Changer rather than separate duplicated processing engines.
- The Speed Changer supports exact target BPM, pitch following speed, preserved
  original pitch, and independent pitch adjustment.
- Vocal Split supports a selectable local 20-second preview, and its private
  Modal GPU processing service is being connected to the application.
- Keep pitch and tempo processing reusable so future focused, SEO-friendly tool
  pages can share the same engine without duplicating logic.
- Audio Chopper Beta provides a high-resolution interactive waveform, direct
  range selection, browser-side zoom/navigation, synchronized playhead, Loop
  Selection, optional processed preview, and MP3 export. Browser interaction
  must reuse the existing trimming engine rather than duplicate final export
  processing inside the component.
- The Mastering Analyzer now provides LUFS, dBFS/true peak, dynamics, stereo
  measurements, mono compatibility, A/B reference comparison, Volume Match,
  and static spectral balance. Keep it distinct from any future AI Mastering
  product.
- Defer accounts, subscriptions, billing, and persistent user files until their
  product and infrastructure requirements are designed.
