## Current Public Beta State

- Home, Key & BPM Finder, Speed Changer, Mastering Analyzer, Audio Chopper, and
  Feedback are available through the sidebar.
- Vocal Split works with a high-quality private Modal/Demucs pipeline, but its
  public processing action is intentionally disabled while cost and access
  controls are designed.
- Audio Chopper Beta has direct waveform selection, wheel and button zoom,
  horizontal navigation, synchronized playback, looping, selection feedback,
  processed preview, and MP3 export.
- PostHog receives privacy-conscious page views and explicit feedback events.
- The application deploys automatically from `main` to Streamlit Community
  Cloud; a reboot is sometimes required before a new build becomes visible.
